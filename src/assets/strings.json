All I can say for now is that I like what I'm doing and I'd like to pursue in this field of IT for some part of my life after my graduation. But keep in mind that I am a very manual person, so there is a considerable possibility that in 10 years from now you would rather find me opening a garage than opening a tech start-up. Time will show everything!"
